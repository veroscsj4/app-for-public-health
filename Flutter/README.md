# mobile_app_for_public_health

# Bioinformatics Pipeline using Docker Compose

This project was developed as part of the "Mobile Applications for Public Health" course at HTW Berlin during the winter semester 2023/2024. The objective was to create a mobile medical application with Flutter, which includes a functional prototype to showcase the potential of a concept/product idea. To achieve this goal, a prototype application named GenoMedicine has been developed. This involves analyzing the human genome to identify its variants. Based on these results, potentially harmful drugs for the user can be identified.

## Getting Started

The App is currently designed for iOS systems. To use it, please download and install the following software:

- Xcode
- Download the Xcode simulators for iPhone by following these steps: Open Xcode, then click Menu > Xcode > Preferences > Select Components
- Visual Studio Code

### Next Steps:

1. Open Visual Studio Code and clone this project.
2. In the terminal, run the following command: `open -a simulator`. This should open the simulator.
3. Once the simulator is open, type the following command in the Visual Studio Code terminal: `flutter run`.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter an error from Xcode, it's likely that your cache is full. Please clear your cache. On macOS systems, follow these steps:

- Go to System Preferences > Storage > Developer > Clear "Xcode Caches".
